## Matching Officers and Board Members

### Two Types of School Board Members

Board members usually come in two 'flavors':
  
  1. Those who expect the Superintendent to make most of the big decisions on district educational philosophy and policy.  A good match for them is a 'moderator' personality for president.  They believe 'staying in their lane' means a more passive approach to education philosophy and policy.
  
  1. Those who prefer a strong, independent board that makes its own decisions about educational philosophy and policy.  A good match for them is a 'process-leader' personality for president.   They envision the board taking a very proactive role in defining the district's education philosophy.  
  
A 'strong leader' does ***NOT*** mean someone with a large personality that talks over everyone, imposes their personal opinions on the board, and shows off at public events.  Actually, it's the opposite of that.  

Openly discuss the traits of a president that best serves your board at that particular point in time BEFORE the next office elections.  (A board need not prefer a certain style forever)  If the role of the board president is discussed before hand, the vote by the members will reflect the group preference, which should be respected.


## Two Types of School Board Leaders

### The Process-Focused Leader

The process-focused leader knows their main job is to orchestrate **how the group makes decisions**, not which particular decision is reached. 

They know:

- Time is a very serious constraint
- Meetings should lead to good choices, given the trade-offs involved
- Groups go through specific steps to make decisions
- Which step the group is at right now
- What the group needs to move ahead
- How to guide talks toward good results
- Which ideas fit with what the board stands for
- How to help the group handle tough choices - they understand trade-offs

Process leaders watch the setting of each choice carefully. They know:

- Closed meetings only need to think about board member views
- Public meetings must include community expectations
- Some choices have bigger public impact than others
- The local politics of issues requiring board decision

These leaders know their fellow board members well.  They meet with members to learn their:

- Strong and weak points
- Views on schools and learning
- Goals for now and the future
- Improvements they hope to see during their term

This helps leaders delegate the right tasks to the right people.  They are decisive if the board is stuck.



### The Participation-Focused Moderator

The Participation-Focused Moderator takes a hands-off approach. They focus on:

- Making sure everyone gets to talk
- Keeping things "fair" above all else
- Letting talks go on with little direction
- Allowing stories and side talks
- Waiting until time runs out to force a choice

This often leads to:

- long meetings with poor results
- Choices made when time runs out, not because they are good
- Inconsistency between board goals, values, and actions
- More worry about seeming fair than getting good results


## Finding a Process-Focused Leader

Look for someone who:

### Meeting Skills
- Creates clear agendas that show what decisions need to be made
- Asks questions that help the group move forward
- Gives brief summaries during meetings to show progress
- Keeps talks focused on what the board values
- Politely brings off-topic talks back on track

### Decision-Making Abilities
- Has helped groups make tough choices before
- Spots when the group is stuck and offers solutions
- Knows when to gather more facts and when to decide
- Helps sort out what matters most when choices compete
- Always ties issues back to how they affect students

### People Skills
- Gets along well with most people
- Thinks about the personalities of each board member relative to upcoming topics
- Appreciates how different members think about issues
- Finds what people agree on when views differ
- Gives tasks to people based on what they do best

### Self-Understanding
- Keeps personal views separate from their leader role
- Listens more than they talk in meetings
- Asks how they could run meetings better
- Changes their approach based on what's needed
- Can explain how they handle tough talks



## Finding a Participation-Focused Moderator

Look for someone who:

### Meeting Skills
- Knows and follows rules of order 
- Goes through agenda items in exact order
- Prefers open discussion over focused discussion
- Applies rules the same way for everyone

### Decision Approach
- Relies mainly on voting constraints to make choices
- Makes sure all views are heard before voting
- Stays neutral on most topics
- Relies on meeting rules to get best results
- Lets talks run their course without re-focusing

### People Skills
- Treats all board members the same way
- Keeps relationships formal and impersonal
- Applies rules the same for friends and others
- Avoids private talks with board business
- Values fair process over building bonds

### Self-Expression
- Often shares their own views after decisions are made
- Wastes time by repeating what others have said
- Speaks firmly about rules and process
- Often mentions their own experiences
- Tries to keep everyone happy


## Screen Your Candidates

### Sample Questions To Identify Leadership Types:

1. "Tell us about a time you helped a group agree on a hard choice."
2. "How do you get ready to lead a meeting with tough issues?"
3. "What do you do when a group gets stuck?"
4. "How do you let everyone speak but still reach a timely decision?"
5. "How do you handle strong disagreements?"
6. "What, to you, is situational awareness?"
7. "How would you run public comment time on controversial topics?"
8. "How do you make sure everyone gets equal time to speak?"
9. "Should the president share their own views during talks?"
10. "What is 'situational awareness' for a board leader?"
11. "Is the amount of time served on a school board more important than leadership ability?"


## Watch How They Work

Notice how potential presidents:

- Run committee meetings
- Join in work sessions
- Handle when people disagree
- Sum up complex ideas
- Balance listening and directing
- Deal with surprises
- Follow-up after meetings


I'm sure you can think of other questions and methods to evaluate the type of candidate under consideration.  It's easier (emotionally and time-wise) to use a succession method of choosing a board president, but <strong style="color: red; font-style: italic; font-size: 120%;">far less effective.</strong>

## The Training Problem

As far as I know, Texas gives very little (or no) training for board members on:

- How groups make good choices
- Balancing benefits, costs, trade-offs
- Evaluating evidence
- Ways to guide and control discussion (hint: reliance on authority of office is a poor method)
- Moving groups smoothly toward decisions
- Using each board member's individual skills well


This means many boards get turn-takers when they need leaders.
