## Time: The True Resource Crisis in Education

>"Children are the world's most valuable resource, and the best hope for the future" ~ attributed to John F. Kennedy

This soaring rhetoric works for politicians but creates serious problems for us as school board members. Fortunately, any board can avoid this particular trap.


## Our Ture 'Most Valuable Resource'

The overused phrase "our children are our most valuable resource" sounds noble but leads to nothing but trouble. First, let's be honest with each other - children are NOT resources, and they certainly don't "belong" to our school districts.  There was a time when more children meant more hands to work the fields, but those days are long gone.

One reason words like these create problems is because they promote a "blank check" mentality where no amount of time or money seems too much to spend in "the best interests of the child" (another overused phrase). Sometimes even our communities develop this impression from our board discussions.

The truth is, ***Time and Money are the only resources a Board actually controls.***

With money, we try to purchase the best talent, wisdom, equipment, and facilities we can afford. After that, the only resource left is Time. There might be more money eventually. But the time spent each year will never return. No student, teacher, staff member, administrator, superintendent, or board member will ever get that time back. **The "whatever it takes" mentality squanders the one truly nonrenewable resource available to our boards - TIME.**

<div class="callout-important">
<strong>Consider this irony:</strong> Politicians demand "Accountability" and extensive disclosure of all financial matters. What about "Accountability" for the time wasted by mandates that have nothing to do with direct instruction?

Our state legislatures need an "Accountability Rating" that measures how much time their mandates consume that could have been spent teaching students. Imagine their faces when that report came out!
</div>

This practical principle offers a better framework than the old cliché. Let's explore why this shift matters and where it could lead us.


## The Hidden Costs of "Whatever It Takes"

The "whatever it takes" approach sounds virtuous but hides a damaging assumption: that time is infinite. This simply isn't true. No one pretends Money is unlimited. So why do we act as if time has no bounds?

### How this harms our districts:

- Our educators, staff, administrators, and board members burn out from endless demands
- Quality suffers as people stretch themselves thin
- Important work receives the same priority as busywork
- Real costs remain hidden and unmanaged
- Quality of life declines for everyone involved in education

## A better approach

Treating time as our most precious resource would transform education in our districts. The important questions would become:

* Will this task, mandate, policy, or strategy increase or reduce time spent in direct instruction?
* Will it add to or decrease time spent on compliance or administrative matters?
* Will this time commitment erode family and personal time?
* What existing programs will lose time because of this new effort?

## Central planning makes the problem worse

Over-regulation by state and federal education bureaucracies severely compresses time for our districts. Since money is limited, we cannot simply hire additional staff to handle new mandates. The only way our districts can maintain compliance is by taking more time from existing employees and volunteers.

## Imagine a 'Time-Conscious' School Board

If we truly valued time as our scarcest resource, our meetings, planning, and operations would change dramatically:

- Our boards would find ways to conduct business responsibly with significantly tighter agendas
- We would become ultra-sensitive to staff and administrators' time commitments
- Most detailed "transparency" presentations could be condensed to executive summaries with supporting materials available separately
- "Soapbox" speeches would disappear
- Multiple activity reports from board members would be replaced by a single designated update
- Every proposal would include a time impact analysis, not just financial assessments
- "Nice to have" initiatives would face additional scrutiny regarding their effects on other priorities
- Value-added activities (especially direct instruction) would receive protection

The shift from asking "Is this a 'good' thing to do?" to "Is this a smart thing to do considering the cost to everyone in time?" would transform our decision-making.


## The Classroom Time Protection Act

If we truly valued our people's time, we would treat teacher-student interaction like gold. We would:

- Question every pull-out from classroom teaching
- Push back against testing that doesn't directly improve learning
- Challenge documentation requirements that don't help students learn
- Create buffers against administrative intrusions from the state
- Measure compliance costs in teacher hours, not just dollars
- Develop grading methods that use instructor time more effectively

When a new state mandate arrives, our first question would be: "How many instructional hours will this consume?"

## Time As an Employee Benefit

There's often an automatic assumption that increasing financial compensation will solve most staffing problems. While low pay contributes to teacher shortages and shouldn't be ignored, the history of public education shows high intrinsic motivation among educators. People who prioritize maximum earnings don't become K-12 teachers.

In our current environment of limited funding (thank you, state legislature), we do control another way to reward employees and volunteers—with time.

When salaries keep pace with inflation, having breaks during the year provides adequate time for family and recharging. When salaries fall behind inflation, educators naturally increase their focus on money. However, time remains highly valued by educators as well.

In a mature system like education, it's difficult to imagine things being different than they've "always been." Yet boards with strong leadership can leverage time to great advantage for their districts.

## Strategies for Creating More Time

The best way to create more time is to become more effective. It's proven that improving quality actually decreases costs, including time costs. Notice I didn't say "efficient." We can be 100% efficient at doing the wrong things—doing the wrong things "righter" doesn't help anyone.

Becoming more effective isn't easy. It requires time, training, leadership, and commitment to examine and refine our systems of delivery, not just focusing on the people delivering services.

We cannot improve effectiveness without allocating time for that important work.

## What We Can Do Tomorrow

If our boards wanted to implement a time-conscious approach immediately, we could:

1. **Audit time costs**: Request an honest accounting of where teacher time currently goes

2. **Create time impact statements**: Require all new initiatives to include time cost estimates

3. **Set time protection priorities**: Identify core activities deserving time protection, including board meeting time

4. **Push back on unfunded time mandates**: When the state requires new tasks, demand that existing requirements be eliminated or fully funded

5. **Make time gifts intentional**: Consider "time back" as a deliberate benefit when raises aren't possible


## Guarding Time Like Money

Perhaps the most valuable shift would be normalizing statements like: "I don't think this is worth the time drain on direct instruction." Currently, this sounds almost heretical in education. But in fields where time is explicitly valued, it's a normal part of prioritization.

The hardest but most important step is creating a culture where people can honestly assess whether an activity adds enough value to justify its time cost. This requires:

- Strong board leadership that supports members who question time-consuming activities
- Clear priorities that help people make time allocation decisions
- Leaders who model time-conscious behavior themselves (especially during board meetings)
- Regular measurement of process efficiency, not just performance results

Valuing time as our most precious resource represents both practical wisdom and a potentially transformative approach to education. By shifting from "no price too high" to "is this worth the time investment given our students' needs," we can refocus on what truly matters: learning.

The greatest value we can provide our educational communities isn't just more money (though that helps) - it's recognizing that everyone's time is finite and precious. When we truly act on that principle, both student achievement and educator satisfaction improve—not because we're doing less, but because we're doing less of what doesn't matter.

## Imagine if...

- Our boards had the courage to value Time as much as Money
- Our meetings became more focused and efficient
- Our relationship with employees and volunteers transformed through time respect
